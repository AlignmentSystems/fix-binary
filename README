FIX BINARY PROTOCOL
=======================

The Financial Information eXchange (FIX) protocol (https://www.fixtrading.org/)
is a standard electronic communications protocol for international real-time 
exchange of information related to securities transactions and markets.  

The FIX standard defines a set of protocols which can be organized in two
classes: ASCII protocols and binary protocols. This plugin (fix_sofh)
implements a subset of the FIX standard based on the binary protocols. 
For support of FIX ASCII protocols, refer to the companion FIX4/FIXT plugin 
(fix4_fixt). 

Some of the protocol specifications supported by this analyzer include:

- SOFH Session Protocol with SBE Encodings (detection and validation)
- SOFH Session Protocol with GPB, ASN.1,FIXTV, FIXML, FAST, JSON, BSON Encodings
  (detection and validation)
- Events: fix_sofh_detected(), fix_sbe_message()
